\section{Conclusion}

98\% of tokens on Ethereum today implement \erc. While attention has been paid to the security of Ethereum DApps, threats to tokens can be specific to \erc functionality. Further, there is no vulnerability reference site (\cf the SWC Registry) specifically for \erc tokens. In this paper, we provide a detailed study of \erc security, collecting and deduplicating \num vulnerabilities and best practices, examining the ability of seven audit tools, and auditing 10 \erc deployments. Most importantly, we provide a concrete implementation of \erc called \sys. It is designed to be secure against known vulnerabilities {\blue and diversifies other implementations}. We test it at Solidity version 0.5.11 (due to the limitation of the audit tools) and also provide it at 0.8.0. \sys  can be used as template to deploy new \erc tokens, migrate current vulnerable deployments, and to benchmark the precision of Ethereum audit tools.
