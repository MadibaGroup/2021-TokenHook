\begin{abstract}
\erc is the most prominent Ethereum standard for transferable tokens. Tokens implementing the \erc interface can interoperate with a large number of already deployed internet-based services and Ethereum-based smart contracts. In recent years, security vulnerabilities in \erc implementations have been uncovered. We systemize these across 7 auditing tools into a set of \num distinct vulnerabilities and best practices. Next, we use our experience to provide a new secure implementation of the \erc interface, \sys, that is freely\footnote{Implementation on Etherscan with source code and deployed on Mainnet and Rinkeby: \url{https://bit.ly/35FMbAf}, \url{https://bit.ly/33wDENx}} available. Reference \erc implementations have been slowly abandoned over time. \sys has enhanced security properties and stronger compliance with best practices compared to the sole surviving reference implementation (from OpenZeppelin) in the \erc specification.
