\section{Full set of vulnerabilities and auditing results}\label{subsec:audits}
The full results of 7 auditing tools run on the Solidity implementation of \sys are provided. We do not describe each vulnerability or best practice at the same level of detail as the ones we highlight in sections~\ref{sec:vul} and~\ref{sec:bp}, however we will include a simple statement describing the issue and the mitigation. We emphasize that categorizing the tests, checking that a specific test is the same across all the tools, validating that a false positive is not an actual vulnerability, and standardizing the cross-references to the SWC registry are all our own contribution. The quality of a result returned by an actual tools varies and does not always lend itself to easy categorization in our charts.
