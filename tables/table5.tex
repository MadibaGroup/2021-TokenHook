		Arithmetic Over/Under Flows & Vul. & + &  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- Vyper includes built-in checks for over/under flows.\\ - \texttt{SafeMath} library is required in Solidity to mitigate the attack.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		Re-Entrancy & Vul. & + &  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- \texttt{@nonreentrant} decorator places a lock on functions to mitigate the attack.\\ - \texttt{noReentrancy} modifier is required in Solidity.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		Unchecked return values & Vul. & + &  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- It is already addressed in Vyper.\\ - There is a need in Solidity to check return values explicitly.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		Code readability & BP. & + &  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- No inheritance in Vyper enforces simpler design.\\ - Solidity allows inline assemblies which is riskier and decreases readability.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		Contract complexity & BP. & + &  & - 300 lines in Vyper have the same functionality as the Solidity with 500 lines. \\ \hline
		Auditable & BP. &  & + & - Most of the auditing tools are able to analyze Solidity contracts. \\ \hline
		Compatibility & BP. &  & + & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- Majority of the current Ethereum projects are based on Solidity.\\ - Developers are more familiar with Solidity than Vyper.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		Production readiness & BP. &  & + & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}- Vyper is not as mature as Solidity in terms of stability, documentation, etc.\\ - Solidity is adapted by a larger development community.\end{tabular} \\ \hline
