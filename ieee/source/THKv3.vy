@title TokenHook v3 (THKv3).
@author Currently ANONYMOUS.
@dev For new token deployment:
1- Install MetaMask (Chrome/Firefox extension).
2- Connect to Rinkeby (or other private/public chains).
3- Run RemixIDE and set environment as "Injected Web3".
4- Copy and past this code in RemixIDE.
5- Deploy the token contract (ERC20).
@dev The code is compatible with version 0.2.8 of Vyper complier.
